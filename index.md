## Speech text
Hi, my name is Dmitriy I am from Kharkiv in Ukreine. And I am studying at frontend developer.I graduated from Kharkiv Technical University as design engineer,but despite this, I have always been interested in IT direction, because this field actively develops, so you can improve yourself and your skills with it.If to speak about my work experience,at my last job I worked as software engineer
at the same time studying prOgramming in such areas as JavaScript, html and some framework.My first experience coding was fun.I really like watching films. At one time, I had a bad internet connection and it was impossible to watch films online,so I decided to download them.But my favorite website didn't have a download button.So I decided to create it.Eeeend the experience was successful and I decided to continue growing in this direction.At the moment I am taking courses in RS school.The last project I worked on was the well-known game Minesweeper.For this I used technologies such as Webpack and CSS preprocessor.I must say  it was difficult for me to learn a new skill in a short time.But in this case, the complexity was synonymous with interesting.Despite the fact that I try to learn on my own, 
I want to improve my knowledge and learn new things with the help of experienced mentors and join the ranks of developers in the world
